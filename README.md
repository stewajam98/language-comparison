# R vs Python Data Modeling Comparison

This repository looks to compare how R and Python handle different data modeling techniques. Specifically, it will show examples of different models, the output that it produces, and my experiences and opinions of how they worked together.

## Organization

Each regressional analysis technique (or group of techniques when applicable) will be included in their own folder. Each of these folders will have the dataset used to perform the analysis, both an R and Python file that performs an analysis, the output from these programs, and a text file that includes the comparision.

## Data

Most of the data that will be used in this repository will be obtained from the tidy-tuesday repository linked [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday). There will be links to the specific page in the discussion file for each sub-folder.


The datasets will be chosen to create the best opportunity to showcase the statisitcal model being utilized. This means that simple and multiple linear regression will utilize similar dataset while the dataset used for logistic regression will be very different.
